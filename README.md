vmc
===

Performs variational Monte Carlo (VMC) calcuations on systems that are
of interest to the authors of this code.

Requires a recent [boost](http://www.boost.org/) (headers only) and
[eigen3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/).  The input mechanism for
declaring calculations also requires
[jsoncpp](http://jsoncpp.sourceforge.net/).

A file named Makefile-vmc.local can be created to override any
variables in the Makefile. For example, it could say:

    EIGEN3_CFLAGS = -I/path/to/eigen3/include
    BOOST_CFLAGS = -I/path/to/boost/include
    CXX = clang++

To compile and run:
$ make && ./vmc < sample-input.json

It should compile on recent versions of g++, clang++, and icc.

Documentation for users
-----------------------

The "vmc" program uses JSON for input and output.  A sample input file
is given as sample-input.json.  More complete documentation about its
structure is coming soon.

API Documentation
-----------------

If doxygen is installed, documentation can be generated by running
$ make docs

Afterwards, HTML documentation will exist at docs/generated/html/index.html

If PDF output is desired, change directory to docs/generated/latex/
and run "make".
